# grocery_calculator

### This is a Grocery Store Calculator app, one of the first projects while learning Flutter...

- The project is written on simple logic that take input as string, and operate them accordingly, whole code is just a bit use of switch-case.
- It also helps to maintain a short history of calculations and one can get rid of them by tapping on "AC" button.

There's obviously a lot of scope for improvement, both UI and functioning wise..so it's open for those who want to contribute and make their first contributory project.


Thanks !!
