# grocery_calculator

### This is a Grocery Store Calculator app, one of the first projects while learning Flutter...

- The project is written on simple logic that take input as string, and operate them accordingly, whole code is just a bit use of switch-case.
- It also helps to maintain a short history of calculations and one can get rid of them by tapping on "AC" button.
- Learnt about state-management using StateFul widgets, and setState() function.
- Type-casting has been used extensively and that gave me a clear understanding of types of variables and their declaration.
- Also helped in understanding and making a proper connection between the UI and the functions.

There's obviously a lot of scope for improvement, both UI and functioning wise..so it's open for those who want to contribute and make their first contributory project.


Thanks !!
